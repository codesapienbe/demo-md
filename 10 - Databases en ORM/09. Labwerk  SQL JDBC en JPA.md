Here is a roadmap to learn JDBC, JPA, and Hibernate for a junior developer:

---

## 1.  Learn the basics of SQL and relational databases

-   Understand the basic concepts of SQL, including data types, tables, relationships, and queries
-   Practice writing SQL statements using a database management system (DBMS) such as MySQL or PostgreSQL. 

The following lab work is for learning the basics of SQL and relational databases using MySQL:

---

### Step 1: Introduction to SQL and Relational Databases

Before we start learning SQL, let's first understand what SQL is and what a relational database is.

SQL stands for Structured Query Language and is used for managing and manipulating data in a relational database. A relational database is a database that organizes data into one or more tables, each with a unique identifier, or "key".

----

### Step 2: Data Types, Tables, and Relationships

Data Types: Every column in a table has a data type associated with it. Common data types include integer, text, date, and float.

Tables: Tables are the basic building blocks of a relational database. They contain columns, which define the data that can be stored, and rows, which contain the actual data.

Relationships: Relationships between tables are established using foreign keys. A foreign key is a column in one table that refers to the primary key of another table.

---

There are different types of relationships that can be established between tables in a relational database:

1.  One-to-One Relationship: In a one-to-one relationship, each record in one table is related to one and only one record in another table. For example, a person can have only one passport, and a passport can belong to only one person.
    
2.  One-to-Many Relationship: In a one-to-many relationship, each record in one table is related to one or more records in another table. For example, a customer can have multiple orders, but each order belongs to only one customer.
    
3.  Many-to-Many Relationship: In a many-to-many relationship, each record in one table is related to one or more records in another table, and vice versa. For example, a student can enroll in multiple courses, and each course can have multiple students.
    

---

To establish a relationship between two tables, a foreign key column is added to the table that needs to reference the other table. The foreign key column contains values that match the values in the primary key column of the other table. This ensures that the data in the tables is consistent and that the relationships between the tables are maintained.

---

Here are some examples for each type of relationship:

1.  One-to-One Relationship:

-   A person can have only one driver's license, and a driver's license can belong to only one person.
-   A country can have only one capital city, and a capital city can belong to only one country.

---

2.  One-to-Many Relationship:

-   A customer can have multiple orders, but each order belongs to only one customer.
-   An employee can have multiple job assignments, but each job assignment belongs to only one employee.

---

3.  Many-to-Many Relationship:

-   A student can enroll in multiple courses, and each course can have multiple students.
-   A book can have multiple authors, and each author can contribute to multiple books.

---

In each example, one table (e.g., Person, Customer, Student, Book) has a primary key column that uniquely identifies each record, and another table (e.g., Driver's License, Order, Job Assignment, Course, Author) has a foreign key column that refers to the primary key column of the first table. This establishes the relationship between the tables and allows for the data to be organized in a meaningful and consistent way.

---

### Step 3: Basic SQL Queries

Now that we understand the basics of SQL and relational databases, let's start learning some basic SQL queries.

Here are some basic SQL queries that can help you understand the basics of SQL and relational databases:

---

1.  SELECT Query: The SELECT query is used to retrieve data from a table. The syntax for the SELECT query is as follows:

`SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name;`

---

For example, to retrieve all the data from a table called "customers", you can use the following query:

`SELECT * FROM customers;`

---

2.  WHERE Clause: The WHERE clause is used to filter data based on a condition. The syntax for the WHERE clause is as follows:

`SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name WHERE condition;`

---

For example, to retrieve all the data from a table called "customers" where the age is greater than 18, you can use the following query:

`SELECT * FROM customers WHERE age > 18;`

---

3.  ORDER BY Clause: The ORDER BY clause is used to sort the data in ascending or descending order. The syntax for the ORDER BY clause is as follows:

`SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name ASC|DESC;`

---

For example, to retrieve all the data from a table called "customers" and sort it by age in descending order, you can use the following query:

`SELECT * FROM customers ORDER BY age DESC;`

---

4.  INSERT Query: The INSERT query is used to add new data to a table. The syntax for the INSERT query is as follows:

`INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...) VALUES (value1, value2, ...);`

---

For example, to add a new customer to a table called "customers", you can use the following query:

`INSERT INTO customers (name, age, city) VALUES ('John Doe', 25, 'New York');`

---

5.  UPDATE Query: The UPDATE query is used to modify existing data in a table. The syntax for the UPDATE query is as follows:

`UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ... WHERE condition;`

---

For example, to update the age of a customer with the name "John Doe" in a table called "customers", you can use the following query:

`UPDATE customers SET age = 26 WHERE name = 'John Doe';`

---

6.  DELETE Query: The DELETE query is used to delete data from a table. The syntax for the DELETE query is as follows:

`DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;`

---

For example, to delete a customer with the name "John Doe" from a table called "customers", you can use the following query:

`DELETE FROM customers WHERE name = 'John Doe';`

---

These are some basic SQL queries that can help you understand the basics of SQL and relational databases. There are many more advanced SQL queries and concepts that you can learn to work with databases more efficiently.

---

### Step 4: Advanced SQL Queries

Now that we know the basics of SQL queries, let's dive into some more advanced queries.

JOIN: The JOIN operation is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. Here's an example:

`SELECT orders.order_id, customers.name, orders.amount FROM orders JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id;`

---

This query will retrieve the order ID, customer name, and order amount from the orders table, and the customer name from the customers table, where the customer ID in the orders table matches the customer ID in the customers table.

GROUP BY: The GROUP BY operation is used to group rows together based on the values in one or more columns. Here's an example:

`SELECT category, SUM(price) as total_sales FROM products GROUP BY category;`

This query will retrieve the total sales for each category of products in the products table.

---

Joins are used in SQL to combine data from two or more tables based on a related column. There are different types of joins, which are used depending on the type of relationship between the tables. Here are some examples of SQL joins:

1.  Inner Join: The Inner join returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables. The syntax for the Inner Join is as follows:

`SELECT table1.column1, table1.column2, ..., table2.column1, table2.column2, ... FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.related_column = table2.related_column;`

---

For example, consider two tables, "customers" and "orders". The customers table has columns for customer ID, name, and email, while the orders table has columns for order ID, customer ID, and order date. To get a list of all customers who have placed an order, you can use the following query:

`SELECT customers.name, orders.order_date FROM customers INNER JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;`

---

2.  Left Join: The Left join returns all the rows from the left table and the matching rows from the right table. If there is no match in the right table, the result will contain null values. The syntax for the Left Join is as follows:

`SELECT table1.column1, table1.column2, ..., table2.column1, table2.column2, ... FROM table1 LEFT JOIN table2 ON table1.related_column = table2.related_column;`

---

For example, consider two tables, "customers" and "orders". The customers table has columns for customer ID, name, and email, while the orders table has columns for order ID, customer ID, and order date. To get a list of all customers and their orders (if any), you can use the following query:

`SELECT customers.name, orders.order_date FROM customers LEFT JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;`

---

3.  Right Join: The Right join returns all the rows from the right table and the matching rows from the left table. If there is no match in the left table, the result will contain null values. The syntax for the Right Join is as follows:

`SELECT table1.column1, table1.column2, ..., table2.column1, table2.column2, ... FROM table1 RIGHT JOIN table2 ON table1.related_column = table2.related_column;`

---

For example, consider two tables, "customers" and "orders". The customers table has columns for customer ID, name, and email, while the orders table has columns for order ID, customer ID, and order date. To get a list of all orders and their customer (if any), you can use the following query:

`SELECT customers.name, orders.order_date FROM customers RIGHT JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;`

---

4.  Full Outer Join: The Full Outer join returns all the rows from both tables, with null values in the columns where there is no match. The syntax for the Full Outer Join is as follows:

`SELECT table1.column1, table1.column2, ..., table2.column1, table2.column2, ... FROM table1 FULL OUTER JOIN table2 ON table1.related_column = table2.related_column;`

---

For example, consider two tables, "customers" and "orders". The customers table has columns for customer ID, name, and email, while the orders table has columns for order ID, customer ID, and order date. To get a list of all customers and their orders, including customers who have not placed any orders, you can use the following query:

`SELECT customers.name, orders.order_date FROM customers FULL OUTER JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;`

---

5.  Self Join: A Self join is used when you want to join a table to itself. In a self join, you must use aliases to distinguish between the two instances of the same table. The syntax for the Self Join is as follows:

`SELECT table1.column1, table1.column2, ..., table2.column1, table2.column2, ... FROM table AS table1 JOIN table AS table2 ON table1.related_column = table2.related_column;`

---

For example, consider a table called "employees" that contains columns for employee ID, name, and manager ID. To get a list of all employees and their managers, you can use the following query:

`SELECT e1.name AS employee_name, e2.name AS manager_name FROM employees AS e1 JOIN employees AS e2 ON e1.manager_id = e2.employee_id;`

In this query, we use aliases "e1" and "e2" to distinguish between the employee and manager instances of the "employees" table.

---

6.  Cross Join: A Cross join returns the Cartesian product of the two tables, which means it returns all possible combinations of rows between the two tables. The syntax for the Cross Join is as follows:

`SELECT table1.column1, table1.column2, ..., table2.column1, table2.column2, ... FROM table1 CROSS JOIN table2;`

---

For example, consider two tables, "colors" and "sizes". The colors table contains columns for color ID and color name, while the sizes table contains columns for size ID and size name. To get a list of all possible combinations of colors and sizes, you can use the following query:

`SELECT colors.color_name, sizes.size_name FROM colors CROSS JOIN sizes;`

In this query, we use a Cross Join to combine every row from the colors table with every row from the sizes table, resulting in a list of all possible color-size combinations.

---

Summary of the different types of JOINs in SQL:

1.  INNER JOIN: Returns only the matching rows between two tables.
    
2.  LEFT JOIN: Returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table.
    
3.  RIGHT JOIN: Returns all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table.
    
4.  FULL OUTER JOIN: Returns all rows from both tables, including non-matching rows.
    
5.  SELF JOIN: Joins a table to itself.
    
6.  CROSS JOIN: Returns the Cartesian product of two tables, which means it returns all possible combinations of rows between the two tables.
    

Each type of JOIN can be used to answer different questions and retrieve different types of data from a relational database.

---

### Step 5: Practice Writing SQL Statements

To practice writing SQL statements, you can use a database management system (DBMS) such as MySQL or PostgreSQL.

Here are a few exercises to get you started:

-   Write a query to retrieve all customers from the customers table.
-   Write a query to insert a new product into the products table.
-   Write a query to update the price of a product in the products table.
-   Write a query to delete a customer from the customers table.

With these exercises, you should be able to practice and improve your SQL skills.

## 2.  Leer JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)

-   Understand the JDBC API and its components such as Connection, Statement, and ResultSet
-   Practice creating database connections, executing queries, and handling exceptions
-   Learn how to use JDBC with different types of databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle

---

### Stap 1: Introductie van JDBC

-   Begrijp de basisprincipes van JDBC API
-   Leer over de belangrijkste onderdelen van JDBC, zoals Connection, Statement en ResultSet
-   Begrijp de stappen om een ​​JDBC-verbinding tot stand te brengen met een database

---

JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) API is a Java API that allows Java applications to interact with a wide range of relational databases. The API provides a set of classes and interfaces for connecting to databases, executing SQL statements, and processing the results. Here are the key components of the JDBC API:

---

1.  Connection: The Connection interface represents a connection to a database. It is responsible for establishing a connection to the database, creating Statement objects, and controlling transactions.
    
2.  Statement: The Statement interface represents an SQL statement that is sent to the database for execution. It can be used to execute SQL queries, updates, and stored procedures.
    
3.  ResultSet: The ResultSet interface represents the result of an executed SQL query. It provides methods for iterating over the rows of the result set and retrieving the values of the columns.
    

---

To establish a JDBC connection to a database, the following steps are typically required:

1.  Load the JDBC driver for the database: This is done by using the Class.forName() method to load the appropriate driver class.
    
2.  Open a connection to the database: This is done by calling the DriverManager.getConnection() method and passing in the database URL, username, and password.
    
3.  Create a Statement object: This is done by calling the Connection.createStatement() method.
    
4.  Execute an SQL query: This is done by calling the Statement.executeQuery() method.
    
5.  Process the ResultSet: This is done by iterating over the rows of the ResultSet and retrieving the values of the columns.
    
6.  Close the connection: This is done by calling the Connection.close() method.
    

By following these steps, a Java application can interact with a relational database using the JDBC API.

---

Here's a more detailed explanation of the steps involved in establishing a JDBC connection:

1.  Load the JDBC driver: Before you can connect to a database, you need to load the appropriate JDBC driver for the database you're using. The driver provides the necessary classes and interfaces to interact with the database. You can load the driver by calling the Class.forName() method and passing in the fully qualified name of the driver class. For example:

`Class.forName("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver");`

---

2.  Open a connection to the database: Once you've loaded the driver, you can open a connection to the database by calling the DriverManager.getConnection() method and passing in the database URL, username, and password. The database URL is a string that specifies the location of the database and the driver to be used. For example:

`Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase", "username", "password");`

---

3.  Create a Statement object: Once you have a connection to the database, you can create a Statement object by calling the createStatement() method of the Connection object. The Statement object is used to execute SQL statements against the database. For example:

`Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();`

---

4.  Execute an SQL query: After you've created a Statement object, you can use it to execute an SQL query by calling the executeQuery() method and passing in the SQL statement as a string. The method returns a ResultSet object, which contains the results of the query. For example:

`ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM customers");`

---

5.  Process the ResultSet: Once you have a ResultSet object, you can use it to retrieve the data returned by the query. You can move through the rows of the ResultSet by calling the next() method, which returns true if there are more rows to be read. You can then retrieve the values of the columns by calling the appropriate getXXX() method on the ResultSet object, where XXX is the data type of the column. For example:

`while (rs.next()) {     String name = rs.getString("name");     int age = rs.getInt("age");     // do something with the data }`

---

6.  Close the connection: After you've finished using the ResultSet and Statement objects, you should close them and the connection to the database by calling their close() methods. For example:

`rs.close(); stmt.close(); conn.close();`

By following these steps, you can establish a JDBC connection to a database and execute SQL queries against it using Java.

---

### Stap 2: Databaseverbinding maken

-   Leer hoe u verbinding kunt maken met een database via JDBC
-   Gebruik de DriverManager-klasse om verbinding te maken met een database
-   Begrijp hoe u de database URL, gebruikersnaam en wachtwoord opgeeft

---

To connect to a database using JDBC, you need to follow these steps:

1.  Load the JDBC driver: Before you can connect to a database, you need to load the appropriate JDBC driver for the database you're using. The driver provides the necessary classes and interfaces to interact with the database. You can load the driver by calling the Class.forName() method and passing in the fully qualified name of the driver class. For example:

`Class.forName("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver");`

---

2.  Establish a connection to the database: Once you've loaded the driver, you can establish a connection to the database by calling the DriverManager.getConnection() method and passing in the database URL, username, and password. The database URL is a string that specifies the location of the database and the driver to be used. For example:

`Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost/mydatabase", "username", "password");`

In the above example, "jdbc:mysql://localhost/mydatabase" is the database URL, "username" is the username for the database, and "password" is the password for the database.

---

3.  Use the connection to interact with the database: Once you have a connection to the database, you can use it to interact with the database by creating Statement, PreparedStatement, or CallableStatement objects, and then executing SQL queries or updates using the appropriate methods of these objects.

For example, to execute a simple SQL query to retrieve data from a table, you can create a Statement object and call its executeQuery() method, like this:

`Statement stmt = conn.createStatement(); ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM customers");`

In the above example, "customers" is the name of the table that you want to retrieve data from.

---

4.  Close the connection: After you've finished using the connection, you should close it by calling its close() method. This will release any resources held by the connection, such as database cursors, locks, and network connections.

`conn.close();`

That's a basic overview of how to connect to a database using JDBC. Keep in mind that the exact steps may vary depending on the database you're using and the JDBC driver you've loaded.

---

### Stap 3: Query's uitvoeren

-   Leer hoe u query's kunt uitvoeren met JDBC
-   Gebruik de Statement-klasse om query's uit te voeren
-   Begrijp hoe u resultaten van query's kunt verwerken met ResultSet

---

Once you've established a connection to a database using JDBC, you can use the Statement class to execute SQL queries against the database. Here are the basic steps to execute a query using JDBC:

1.  Create a Statement object: To execute a query, you first need to create a Statement object using the Connection object. For example:

`Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();`

---

2.  Execute the query: Once you have a Statement object, you can execute a query by calling its executeQuery() method and passing in the SQL statement as a string. For example:

`ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM customers");`

This statement will execute a SELECT query on the "customers" table and return a ResultSet object that contains the results of the query.

---

3.  Process the results: To process the results of a query, you can use the ResultSet object. The ResultSet object contains the rows returned by the query, and you can use its methods to retrieve the values of individual columns in each row. For example:

```java
while (rs.next()) {     
	int id = rs.getInt("id");     
	String name = rs.getString("name");     
	String email = rs.getString("email");     
	System.out.println(id + ", " + name + ", " + email); 
}
```

This code will loop through each row in the ResultSet and print out the values of the "id", "name", and "email" columns.

---

4.  Close the Statement and ResultSet objects: After you've finished processing the results of the query, you should close the Statement and ResultSet objects to release any resources held by them. For example:

`rs.close(); stmt.close();`

That's a basic overview of how to execute queries using JDBC. Keep in mind that there are other classes and methods available in the JDBC API that you can use to execute different types of queries and handle different types of result sets.

---

### Stap 4: Uitzonderingen afhandelen

-   Begrijp de uitzonderingen die kunnen optreden tijdens het uitvoeren van JDBC-activiteiten
-   Leer hoe u uitzonderingen kunt afhandelen met behulp van try-catch-blokken
-   Begrijp de SQLException-klasse en zijn belangrijkste methoden

---

JDBC operations, like any other program, can result in exceptions. The most common exceptions in JDBC are SQLExceptions, which can be thrown for a variety of reasons, such as invalid SQL syntax, database connection issues, and database constraint violations.

To handle these exceptions in your JDBC code, you can use try-catch blocks. Here are the basic steps:

1.  Wrap JDBC code in a try-catch block: Any JDBC code that can potentially throw an exception should be wrapped in a try-catch block. For example:

`try {     // JDBC code that might throw an exception } catch (SQLException ex) {     // Exception handling code }`

---

2.  Catch specific exceptions: If you know what kind of exception might be thrown, you can catch it explicitly in the catch block. For example:

`try {     // JDBC code that might throw an exception } catch (SQLException ex) {     if (ex.getErrorCode() == 1062) {         System.out.println("Duplicate entry error: " + ex.getMessage());     } else {         System.out.println("SQL error: " + ex.getMessage());     } }`

This code catches a SQLException and checks its error code to determine if it's a duplicate entry error. If it is, it prints a specific message. Otherwise, it prints a general SQL error message.

---

3.  Handle exceptions appropriately: Depending on the type of exception and the requirements of your application, you may need to handle exceptions differently. Some common strategies for handling exceptions in JDBC include:

-   Logging the exception for debugging purposes
-   Rolling back transactions if an exception occurs
-   Prompting the user to correct input errors that caused the exception

That's a basic overview of how to handle exceptions in JDBC. Keep in mind that the SQLException class has many methods that can be used to get information about the exception, such as the error message, error code, and SQL state. You can use these methods to provide more detailed error messages to users or to debug issues in your code.

---

### Stap 5: Gebruik JDBC met verschillende databases

-   Leer hoe u JDBC kunt gebruiken met verschillende databases zoals MySQL, PostgreSQL en Oracle
-   Begrijp de database-specifieke configuraties die nodig zijn om JDBC met elke database te gebruiken

---

JDBC is designed to be database-agnostic, which means it can be used with any relational database that supports SQL. However, different databases have different configurations and requirements for using JDBC. Here are some tips for using JDBC with different databases:

1.  MySQL: To use JDBC with MySQL, you will need to download and install the MySQL Connector/J driver. Once you have the driver, you can use the following code to establish a connection:

`String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase"; String user = "username"; String password = "password"; Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(url, user, password);`

Note that the "mydatabase" in the URL should be replaced with the name of your database.

---

2.  PostgreSQL: To use JDBC with PostgreSQL, you will need to download and install the PostgreSQL JDBC driver. Once you have the driver, you can use the following code to establish a connection:

`String url = "jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/mydatabase"; String user = "username"; String password = "password"; Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(url, user, password);`

Again, "mydatabase" should be replaced with the name of your database.

---

3.  Oracle: To use JDBC with Oracle, you will need to download and install the Oracle JDBC driver. Once you have the driver, you can use the following code to establish a connection:

`String url = "jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:mydatabase"; String user = "username"; String password = "password"; Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(url, user, password);`

In this case, "mydatabase" should be replen Javaaced with the Oracle service name or SID.

---

4.  Other databases: To use JDBC with other databases, you will need to consult the documentation for your specific database to determine the correct JDBC driver and configuration options.

Overall, the process for using JDBC with different databases is similar. You will need to download the appropriate JDBC driver, provide the correct URL, username, and password for your database, and use the standard JDBC API to execute SQL statements and retrieve data.

---

### Stap 6: Labwerk

 Before following the tasks, make sure you have the following in place −

-   You should have admin privilege to create a database in the given schema. To execute the following example, you need to replace the _username_ and _password_ with your actual user name and password.
    
-   Your MySQL server database is up and running.

---    

#### JDBC - Create Database

The following steps are required to create a new Database using JDBC application −

-   **Import the packages** − Requires that you include the packages containing the JDBC classes needed for database programming. Most often, using _import java.sql.*_ will suffice.
    
-   **Open a connection** − Requires using the _DriverManager.getConnection()_ method to create a Connection object, which represents a physical connection with the database server.
    
    To create a new database, you need not give any database name while preparing database URL as mentioned in the below example.
    
-   **Execute a query** − Requires using an object of type Statement for building and submitting an SQL statement to the database.
    
-   **Clean up the environment .** try with resources automatically closes the resources.
    

---

```java

import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.SQLException;
import java.sql.Statement;

public class JDBCExample {
   static final String DB_URL = "jdbc:mysql://localhost/";
   static final String USER = "guest";
   static final String PASS = "guest123";

   public static void main(String[] args) {
      // Open a connection
      try(Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(DB_URL, USER, PASS);
         Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();
      ) {		      
         String sql = "CREATE DATABASE STUDENTS";
         stmt.executeUpdate(sql);
         System.out.println("Database created successfully...");   	  
      } catch (SQLException e) {
         e.printStackTrace();
      } 
   }
}

```


When you run **JDBCExample**, it produces the following result:

```console
Database created successfully...
```

#### JDBC - Choose Database

This chapter provides an example on how to select a Database using JDBC application. Before executing the following example, make sure you have the following in place −

-   To execute the following example you need to replace the _username_ and _password_ with your actual user name and password.
    
-   Your MySQL or whatever database you are using, is up and running.
    

---

The following steps are required to create a new Database using JDBC application −

-   **Import the packages** − Requires that you include the packages containing the JDBC classes needed for the database programming. Most often, using _import java.sql.*_ will suffice.
    
-   **Open a connection** − Requires using the _DriverManager.getConnection()_ method to create a Connection object, which represents a physical connection with a **selected** database.
    
    Selection of database is made while you prepare database URL. Following example would make connection with **STUDENTS** database.
    
-   **Clean up the environment** − try with resources automatically closes the resources.
    

---

```java

import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.SQLException;
import java.sql.Statement;

public class JDBCExample {
   static final String DB_URL = "jdbc:mysql://localhost/TUTORIALSPOINT";
   static final String USER = "guest";
   static final String PASS = "guest123";

   public static void main(String[] args) {
      System.out.println("Connecting to a selected database...");
      // Open a connection
      try(Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(DB_URL, USER, PASS);) {		      
         System.out.println("Connected database successfully...");  
      } catch (SQLException e) {
         e.printStackTrace();
      } 
   }
}

```


```console
Connecting to a selected database...
Connected database successfully...
```

#### JDBC - Drop a Database

This chapter provides an example on how to drop an existing Database using JDBC application. Before executing the following example, make sure you have the following in place −

-   To execute the following example you need to replace the _username_ and _password_ with your actual user name and password.
    
-   Your MySQL is up and running.
    

**NOTE:** This is a serious operation and you have to make a firm decision before proceeding to delete a database because everything you have in your database would be lost.

---

The following steps are required to create a new Database using JDBC application −

-   **Import the packages** − Requires that you include the packages containing the JDBC classes needed for database programming. Most often, using _import java.sql.*_ will suffice.
    
-   **Open a connection** − Requires using the _DriverManager.getConnection()_ method to create a Connection object, which represents a physical connection with a database server.
    
    Deleting a database does not require database name to be in your database URL. Following example would delete **STUDENTS** database.
    
-   **Execute a query** − Requires using an object of type Statement for building and submitting an SQL statement to delete the database.
    
-   **Clean up the environment** − try with resources automatically closes the resources.

```java

import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.SQLException;
import java.sql.Statement;

public class JDBCExample {
   static final String DB_URL = "jdbc:mysql://localhost/";
   static final String USER = "guest";
   static final String PASS = "guest123";

   public static void main(String[] args) {
      // Open a connection
      try(Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(DB_URL, USER, PASS);
         Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();
      ) {		      
         String sql = "DROP DATABASE STUDENTS";
         stmt.executeUpdate(sql);
         System.out.println("Database dropped successfully...");   	  
      } catch (SQLException e) {
         e.printStackTrace();
      } 
   }
}

```

The console will print the following:

```console
Database dropped successfully...
```

### Opdrachten:

---

1.  Maak een Java-toepassing die verbinding maakt met een MySQL-database en een eenvoudige query uitvoert om gegevens op te halen.

---

Hier is een voorbeeldopdracht om een Java-toepassing te maken die verbinding maakt met een MySQL-database en een eenvoudige query uitvoert om gegevens op te halen:

- Download de MySQL Connector/J-driver van de officiële website van MySQL en voeg deze toe aan uw project.
   
- Importeer de benodigde JDBC-klassen:

```java
import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.ResultSet;
import java.sql.Statement;
import java.sql.SQLException;

```

---

- Maak een methode om een verbinding met de database tot stand te brengen:

```java
public static Connection getConnection() throws SQLException {
    String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase";
    String user = "username";
    String password = "password";
    Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(url, user, password);
    return conn;
}
```

---

Vervang 'mydatabase', 'username' en 'password' met uw eigen database-, gebruikersnaam- en wachtwoordgegevens. 4. Maak een methode om de query uit te voeren:

```java
public static void executeQuery(Connection conn) throws SQLException {
    Statement stmt = null;
    ResultSet rs = null;
    try {
        stmt = conn.createStatement();
        rs = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM users");
        while (rs.next()) {
            int id = rs.getInt("id");
            String name = rs.getString("name");
            String email = rs.getString("email");
            System.out.println("User #" + id + ": " + name + " (" + email + ")");
        }
    } finally {
        if (rs != null) rs.close();
        if (stmt != null) stmt.close();
    }
}
```

In dit voorbeeld voert de query de gegevens uit de 'users'-tabel op en toont de resultaten op de console. 

---

Roep de methoden aan om de verbinding en de query uit te voeren:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Connection conn = null;
    try {
        conn = getConnection();
        executeQuery(conn);
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        System.err.println("Error executing query: " + e.getMessage());
    } finally {
        if (conn != null) {
            try {
                conn.close();
            } catch (SQLException e) {
                System.err.println("Error closing connection: " + e.getMessage());
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Dit is de main-methode die de verbinding met de database tot stand brengt en de query uitvoert. Er is ook een try-catch-blok om eventuele uitzonderingen op te vangen en de verbinding te sluiten als deze niet langer nodig is.

Als u deze code uitvoert, moet u de gegevens uit de 'users'-tabel op de console zien verschijnen.
   
---

2.  Maak een toepassing die verbinding maakt met een PostgreSQL-database en een update-query uitvoert om gegevens bij te werken.

---

Hier is een voorbeeld van een Java-toepassing die verbinding maakt met een PostgreSQL-database en een update-query uitvoert om gegevens bij te werken:

```java
import java.sql.*;

public class UpdateExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String url = "jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/mydatabase";
        String username = "myusername";
        String password = "mypassword";
        
        try (Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(url, username, password)) {
            String sql = "UPDATE users SET age = ? WHERE id = ?";
            PreparedStatement stmt = conn.prepareStatement(sql);
            stmt.setInt(1, 30); // set age to 30
            stmt.setInt(2, 1); // set id to 1
            int rowsUpdated = stmt.executeUpdate();
            if (rowsUpdated > 0) {
                System.out.println("Data updated successfully.");
            } else {
                System.out.println("No data updated.");
            }
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            System.out.println("Error executing update: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}

```

---

In dit voorbeeld wordt de `DriverManager`-klasse gebruikt om verbinding te maken met de PostgreSQL-database met behulp van de URL, gebruikersnaam en wachtwoord. Vervolgens wordt een voorbereide verklaring gemaakt voor de update-query. De leeftijd wordt ingesteld op 30 en de ID op 1. De `executeUpdate()` methode wordt uitgevoerd op de voorbereide verklaring om de gegevens bij te werken en het aantal bijgewerkte rijen wordt geretourneerd. Tot slot wordt een bericht afgedrukt om aan te geven of de update succesvol was of niet. Als er een SQL-fout optreedt, wordt deze afgedrukt met behulp van de `getMessage()` methode van de `SQLException`.

---

3.  Maak een toepassing die verbinding maakt met een Oracle-database en een stored procedure uitvoert om gegevens op te halen.

---

Hier is een voorbeeld van een Java-toepassing die verbinding maakt met een Oracle-database en een stored procedure uitvoert om gegevens op te halen:

```java
import java.sql.*;

public class StoredProcedureExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String url = "jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:mydatabase";
        String username = "myusername";
        String password = "mypassword";
        
        try (Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(url, username, password)) {
            CallableStatement stmt = conn.prepareCall("{call get_employee(?, ?)}");
            stmt.setInt(1, 123); // set employee id to 123
            stmt.registerOutParameter(2, Types.VARCHAR); // register output parameter
            stmt.execute();
            String employeeName = stmt.getString(2);
            System.out.println("Employee name: " + employeeName);
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            System.out.println("Error executing stored procedure: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}

```

---

In dit voorbeeld wordt de `DriverManager`-klasse gebruikt om verbinding te maken met de Oracle-database met behulp van de URL, gebruikersnaam en wachtwoord. Vervolgens wordt een `CallableStatement` gemaakt voor de stored procedure "get_employee". De werknemers-ID wordt ingesteld op 123 met behulp van `setInt()` en er wordt een uitvoerparameter geregistreerd voor het werknemersnaamveld met behulp van `registerOutParameter()`. De `execute()` methode wordt uitgevoerd op de `CallableStatement` om de stored procedure uit te voeren en de werknemersnaam wordt opgehaald uit de uitvoerparameter met behulp van `getString()`. Tot slot wordt de werknemersnaam afgedrukt. Als er een SQL-fout optreedt, wordt deze afgedrukt met behulp van de `getMessage()` methode van de `SQLException`.

---

De `get_employee()` stored procedure is een voorbeeld van een opgeslagen procedure in een Oracle-database die wordt uitgevoerd via een JDBC-toepassing. Deze procedure accepteert één invoerparameter - het werknemers-ID - en retourneert één uitvoerparameter - de werknemersnaam.

---

De stored procedure kan worden gemaakt in de Oracle-database met de volgende SQL-code:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE get_employee (
    p_employee_id IN NUMBER,
    p_employee_name OUT VARCHAR2
)
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT employee_name INTO p_employee_name FROM employees WHERE employee_id = p_employee_id;
END;
```

---

Dit SQL-script maakt de `get_employee()` stored procedure aan met twee parameters: `p_employee_id` als invoerparameter en `p_employee_name` als uitvoerparameter. De procedure haalt de werknemersnaam op uit de "employees" tabel met behulp van het werknemers-ID en slaat de waarde op in de `p_employee_name` parameter.

Wanneer deze stored procedure wordt uitgevoerd via een JDBC-toepassing zoals hierboven beschreven, wordt de invoerparameter ingesteld met behulp van `setInt()` en de uitvoerparameter wordt geregistreerd met `registerOutParameter()`. Nadat de procedure is uitgevoerd met behulp van `execute()`, kan de waarde van de uitvoerparameter worden opgehaald met `getString()`.

### Explanation of JPA usage in Java in a similar way to JDBC.

JPA (Java Persistence API) is a Java API for object-relational mapping (ORM), which is used to manage relational data in Java applications. JPA is a high-level API that simplifies the process of working with relational databases in Java by allowing developers to work with Java objects instead of SQL queries.

---

To use JPA in Java, there are a few basic steps:

1.  Define a JPA entity class: A JPA entity class represents a table in a database. It contains fields that map to columns in the table, and annotations that specify how the fields are mapped. The entity class must be annotated with the `@Entity` annotation to indicate that it is a JPA entity.
    

---

2.  Create a persistence unit: A persistence unit is a configuration that tells JPA how to connect to the database. It specifies the database driver, URL, username, password, and other details. The persistence unit is typically defined in a `persistence.xml` file.
    

---

3.  Create an EntityManagerFactory: The EntityManagerFactory is a factory class that creates EntityManager instances. It is created by passing the persistence unit name to the `Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory()` method.
    

---

4.  Create an EntityManager: The EntityManager is the main interface to the JPA API. It is used to interact with the database, including persisting entities, fetching entities, and executing queries. The EntityManager is created by calling the `createEntityManager()` method on the EntityManagerFactory.
    

---

5.  Perform CRUD operations: Once the EntityManager is created, you can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the JPA entities. These operations are done through the EntityManager's methods, such as `persist()`, `find()`, `merge()`, and `remove()`.
    

---

Overall, JPA simplifies the process of working with relational databases in Java by allowing developers to work with Java objects instead of SQL queries. It provides a high-level API that makes it easy to perform CRUD operations on JPA entities, and it handles many of the details of database access, such as connection management and transaction handling.

---

Here's an example of how to retrieve data from a database using both JDBC and JPA:

| JDBC Usage:

```java
public List<Person> getAllPeople() {
    Connection conn = null;
    Statement stmt = null;
    ResultSet rs = null;
    List<Person> people = new ArrayList<>();

    try {
        conn = DriverManager.getConnection(DB_URL, USER, PASS);
        stmt = conn.createStatement();
        String sql = "SELECT * FROM people";
        rs = stmt.executeQuery(sql);

        while (rs.next()) {
            int id = rs.getInt("id");
            String name = rs.getString("name");
            int age = rs.getInt("age");
            String address = rs.getString("address");
            String phone = rs.getString("phone");
            Person person = new Person(id, name, age, address, phone);
            people.add(person);
        }
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    } finally {
        try {
            if (rs != null) rs.close();
            if (stmt != null) stmt.close();
            if (conn != null) conn.close();
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

    return people;
}

```

---

| JPA usage:

```java
public List<Person> getAllPeople() {
    EntityManagerFactory emf = Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory("my-persistence-unit");
    EntityManager em = emf.createEntityManager();
    List<Person> people = null;

    try {
        TypedQuery<Person> query = em.createQuery("SELECT p FROM Person p", Person.class);
        people = query.getResultList();
    } catch (Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    } finally {
        em.close();
        emf.close();
    }

    return people;
}
```

---

As we can see, the JPA version is shorter and more concise than the JDBC version. JPA provides an object-oriented interface that allows you to work with entities rather than SQL queries.

---

Here are examples of CRUD operations using both JDBC and JPA:

**Create:** JDBC:

```java
// create a new record in the database using JDBC
String sql = "INSERT INTO users (username, password) VALUES (?, ?)";
try (PreparedStatement stmt = conn.prepareStatement(sql)) {
    stmt.setString(1, "johndoe");
    stmt.setString(2, "password123");
    int rowsInserted = stmt.executeUpdate();
    System.out.println(rowsInserted + " rows inserted.");
} catch (SQLException e) {
    System.out.println("Error inserting record: " + e.getMessage());
}

```

---

**Create:** JPA:

```java
// create a new record in the database using JPA
User user = new User();
user.setUsername("johndoe");
user.setPassword("password123");
EntityManager em = emf.createEntityManager();
EntityTransaction tx = em.getTransaction();
tx.begin();
em.persist(user);
tx.commit();
em.close();

```

---


**Read:** JDBC:

```java
// retrieve a record from the database using JDBC
String sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?";
try (PreparedStatement stmt = conn.prepareStatement(sql)) {
    stmt.setInt(1, 1);
    ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery();
    if (rs.next()) {
        String username = rs.getString("username");
        String password = rs.getString("password");
        System.out.println("Username: " + username);
        System.out.println("Password: " + password);
    }
} catch (SQLException e) {
    System.out.println("Error retrieving record: " + e.getMessage());
}


```

---

**Read:** JPA:

```java
// retrieve a record from the database using JPA
EntityManager em = emf.createEntityManager();
User user = em.find(User.class, 1);
if (user != null) {
    String username = user.getUsername();
    String password = user.getPassword();
    System.out.println("Username: " + username);
    System.out.println("Password: " + password);
}
em.close();


```


**Update:** JDBC:

```java
// update a record in the database using JDBC
String sql = "UPDATE users SET password = ? WHERE id = ?";
try (PreparedStatement stmt = conn.prepareStatement(sql)) {
    stmt.setString(1, "newpassword");
    stmt.setInt(2, 1);
    int rowsUpdated = stmt.executeUpdate();
    System.out.println(rowsUpdated + " rows updated.");
} catch (SQLException e) {
    System.out.println("Error updating record: " + e.getMessage());
}


```

---

**Update:** JPA:

```java
// update a record in the database using JPA
EntityManager em = emf.createEntityManager();
EntityTransaction tx = em.getTransaction();
tx.begin();
User user = em.find(User.class, 1);
if (user != null) {
    user.setPassword("newpassword");
}
tx.commit();
em.close();


```

---

**Delete:** JDBC:

```java
// delete a record from the database using JDBC
String sql = "DELETE FROM users WHERE id = ?";
try (PreparedStatement stmt = conn.prepareStatement(sql)) {
    stmt.setInt(1, 1);
    int rowsDeleted = stmt.executeUpdate();
    System.out.println(rowsDeleted + " rows deleted.");
} catch (SQLException e) {
    System.out.println("Error deleting record: " + e.getMessage());
}


```

---

**Delete:** JPA:

```java
// delete a record from the database using JPA
EntityManager em = emf.createEntityManager();
EntityTransaction tx = em.getTransaction();
tx.begin();
User user = em.find(User.class, 1);
if (user != null) {
    em.remove(user);
}
tx.commit();
em.close();


```

### Similarities between JDBC and JPA:

-   Both JDBC and JPA are used to interact with databases in Java applications.
-   Both can be used for basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
-   Both require a connection to be established with the database.

Differences between JDBC and JPA:

-   JDBC is a low-level API for interacting with databases, while JPA is a high-level API that provides an object-relational mapping (ORM) framework.
-   JDBC requires manual mapping of Java objects to database tables, while JPA automatically maps Java objects to database tables based on the entity classes and their annotations.
-   JDBC requires manual handling of SQL queries and result sets, while JPA provides a higher-level query language (JPQL) that is database-agnostic and can be used with any database supported by JPA.
-   JDBC provides more control and flexibility over the database interactions, while JPA abstracts away many of the database-specific details and provides a simpler and more convenient API for most use cases.
-   JDBC can be used with any database system, while JPA requires a provider implementation for each database system (e.g. Hibernate for MySQL, EclipseLink for Oracle, etc.).
-   JDBC has a steeper learning curve compared to JPA, which can be easier to use for developers who are not familiar with SQL or database concepts.

Here's an example of how Hibernate helps developers map Java objects to database tables:

Suppose we have a Java class called `Product` that we want to map to a database table called `product` with columns `id`, `name`, and `price`. We can use Hibernate annotations to specify the mapping between the class and the table:

---

```java
@Entity
@Table(name = "product")
public class Product {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    @Column(name = "name")
    private String name;

    @Column(name = "price")
    private BigDecimal price;

    // getters and setters
}

```

---

In this example, the `@Entity` annotation specifies that this class is a Hibernate entity, and the `@Table` annotation specifies the name of the database table. The `@Id` annotation specifies that the `id` field is the primary key, and the `@GeneratedValue` annotation specifies that the value of the primary key is generated by the database. The `@Column` annotations specify the names of the columns in the table that correspond to the fields in the class.

With this mapping in place, we can use Hibernate to persist instances of the `Product` class to the database:

---

```java
Session session = sessionFactory.openSession();
Transaction tx = session.beginTransaction();

Product product = new Product();
product.setName("Widget");
product.setPrice(new BigDecimal("9.99"));

session.save(product);
tx.commit();

session.close();

```

---

In this example, we use the `SessionFactory` to obtain a new `Session` object, which we use to begin a transaction. We create a new instance of the `Product` class, set its properties, and call `session.save(product)` to persist it to the database. Finally, we commit the transaction and close the session.

This is just a simple example, but it demonstrates how Hibernate can be used to map Java objects to database tables and manage their persistence.

## Learn advanced topics in JPA and Hibernate

-   Learn about JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language) and Criteria API for querying data using JPA
-   Learn about caching, lazy loading, and performance tuning in Hibernate
-   Learn about transactions and how to use them in JPA and Hibernate

---

To learn advanced topics in JPA and Hibernate, you can follow these steps:

1.  Learn about JPQL and Criteria API:
    
    -   JPQL is a query language used to write database queries in JPA. It is similar to SQL, but it operates on JPA entities instead of database tables.
    -   Criteria API is an alternative way of writing queries in JPA, using a type-safe, object-oriented API instead of a string-based query language.
    -   Practice writing JPQL queries and Criteria queries to retrieve data from a database.

---

2.  Learn about caching, lazy loading, and performance tuning in Hibernate:
    
    -   Caching is a technique used to improve performance by storing frequently accessed data in memory.
    -   Lazy loading is a feature of Hibernate that delays the loading of associated objects until they are actually needed.
    -   Performance tuning involves optimizing Hibernate configurations and database settings to improve the performance of your application.
    -   Practice configuring caching, lazy loading, and performance tuning in Hibernate.

---

3.  Learn about transactions in JPA and Hibernate:
    
    -   Transactions are used to ensure that a set of database operations are executed atomically and either succeed or fail as a unit.
    -   JPA and Hibernate provide support for transactions through the EntityManager and Session interfaces.
    -   Learn how to use transactions in JPA and Hibernate to ensure data integrity and consistency.
    -   Practice writing code that uses transactions to update and retrieve data from a database.

---

4.  Learn about other advanced topics:
    
    -   There are many other advanced topics to explore in JPA and Hibernate, such as auditing, concurrency control, and event listeners.
    -   Read documentation and books, attend training courses and webinars, and participate in online forums to deepen your understanding of these topics.
    -   Practice implementing these advanced features in your own JPA and Hibernate projects.

## Build a project using JPA and Hibernate

-   Build a small project that uses JPA and Hibernate to persist and retrieve data from a database
-   Use best practices such as creating reusable DAO (Data Access Object) and service classes, and separating the database configuration from the application code

---

Steps to build a project using JPA and Hibernate:

1.  Set up the project environment:
    
    -   Create a new Java project in your favorite IDE
    -   Add the JPA and Hibernate dependencies to the project's classpath
    -   Configure the database connection by specifying the JDBC driver, database URL, username, and password

---

2.  Define the data model:
    
    -   Define the Java classes that will represent the data entities you want to persist
    -   Annotate the classes with the appropriate JPA annotations, such as `@Entity`, `@Id`, `@Column`, and `@OneToMany`, to map them to database tables and establish relationships between them

---

3.  Create the DAO (Data Access Object) layer:
    
    -   Define a DAO interface that declares the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations you want to perform on the data entities
    -   Create a concrete implementation of the DAO interface using JPA and Hibernate
    -   Use the JPA `EntityManager` to create, read, update, and delete the data entities

---

4.  Create the service layer:
    
    -   Define a service interface that declares the business logic operations you want to perform on the data entities
    -   Create a concrete implementation of the service interface that uses the DAO layer to perform the CRUD operations
    -   Optionally, add caching or other optimizations to improve performance

---

5.  Test the application:
    
    -   Create a test suite that exercises the service layer and verifies that the data entities are persisted and retrieved correctly
    -   Use an in-memory database for testing to avoid interfering with the production database

---

6.  Refactor the code:
    
    -   Use best practices such as extracting common code into utility classes, following naming conventions, and using design patterns to improve the code's structure and readability
    -   Separate the database configuration from the application code by using external configuration files or dependency injection


---

By following these steps, you can build a robust and scalable application using JPA and Hibernate. Remember to keep an eye on performance and scalability as your data grows, and consider using advanced techniques such as caching, lazy loading, and performance tuning to optimize your application.
