## Inleiding Streams

One of the key features of Java is the concept of streams. Streams are used to perform operations on a collection of data in a sequential and parallel manner. In this tutorial, we will learn about streams in Java.

## What are Streams?

Streams are used to perform operations on a collection of data. They allow you to perform operations like filtering, mapping, and reducing on the collection of data. Streams can be used on arrays, lists, sets, and maps.

## Creating a Stream

You can create a stream from a collection by calling the stream() method on the collection. For example:

```java
List<String> list = Arrays.asList("one", "two", "three");
Stream<String> stream = list.stream();
```

## Operations on Streams

Streams provide two types of operations: intermediate operations and terminal operations. Intermediate operations are used to perform transformations on the stream, while terminal operations are used to produce a result.

### Intermediate Operations

Intermediate operations are used to perform transformations on the stream. Some of the commonly used intermediate operations are:

-   filter(): It is used to filter the elements of the stream based on a given predicate. For example:

```java
List<String> list = Arrays.asList("one", "two", "three");
Stream<String> stream = list.stream().filter(s -> s.startsWith("t"));
```

This will create a stream containing only the elements that start with "t".

-   map(): It is used to apply a function to each element of the stream. For example:

```java
List<String> list = Arrays.asList("one", "two", "three");
Stream<Integer> stream = list.stream().map(s -> s.length());
```

This will create a stream containing the length of each string.

-   flatMap(): It is used to flatten a stream of streams into a single stream. For example:

```java
List<List<Integer>> list = Arrays.asList(Arrays.asList(1, 2), Arrays.asList(3, 4));
Stream<Integer> stream = list.stream().flatMap(Collection::stream);
```

This will create a stream containing all the integers in the nested lists.

### Terminal Operations

Terminal operations are used to produce a result from the stream. Some of the commonly used terminal operations are:

-   forEach(): It is used to perform an action on each element of the stream. For example:

```java
List<String> list = Arrays.asList("one", "two", "three");
list.stream().forEach(System.out::println);
```

This will print all the elements of the stream.

-   count(): It is used to count the number of elements in the stream. For example:

```java
List<String> list = Arrays.asList("one", "two", "three");
long count = list.stream().count();
```

This will return the number of elements in the stream.

-   collect(): It is used to collect the elements of the stream into a collection. For example:

```java
List<String> list = Arrays.asList("one", "two", "three");
List<String> newList = list.stream().filter(s -> s.startsWith("t")).collect(Collectors.toList());
```

This will create a new list containing only the elements that start with "t".

## Parallel Streams

Streams can also be processed in parallel, which can improve the performance of the operations on large collections. You can create a parallel stream by calling the parallelStream() method on the collection. For example:

```java
List<String> list = Arrays.asList("one", "two", "three");
Stream<String> parallelStream = list.parallelStream();
```

## Ordering of Streams

Streams can be either ordered or unordered. Ordered streams maintain the order of the elements in the collection, while unordered streams do not. You can create an ordered stream by calling the stream() method on the collection, and an unordered stream by calling the parallelStream() method on the collection. For example:

```java
List<String> list = Arrays.asList("one", "two", "three");
Stream<String> orderedStream = list.stream();
Stream<String> unorderedStream = list.parallelStream().unordered();
```

## Stream Reduction

Stream reduction is a process of reducing a stream of elements to a single value. The reduction can be done using the reduce() method. For example:

```java
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
int sum = numbers.stream().reduce(0, (a, b) -> a + b);
```

This will calculate the sum of all the elements in the stream.

## Stream Short-circuiting

Stream short-circuiting is a process of terminating the stream when a certain condition is met. The short-circuiting operations are:

-   anyMatch(): It returns true if any element of the stream matches the given predicate. For example:

```java
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
boolean anyMatch = numbers.stream().anyMatch(n -> n > 3);
```

This will return true if any of the elements in the stream is even.

-   allMatch(): It is used to check if all the elements in the stream match a given predicate. For example:

```java
List<Integer> list = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4);
boolean result = list.stream().allMatch(n -> n % 2 == 0);
```

This will return false as not all the elements in the stream are even.

-   noneMatch(): It is used to check if none of the elements in the stream match a given predicate. For example:

```java
List<Integer> list = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4);
boolean result = list.stream().noneMatch(n -> n % 5 == 0);
```

This will return true as none of the elements in the stream are divisible by 5.
